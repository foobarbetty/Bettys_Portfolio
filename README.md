Hey there! How's it going? 

I’m Elisabete (pronounced eee-lisa-bet), also known as “Betty”. Welcome to my GitHub Repository!

As a programmer, I write code to build tools that solve problems. I'm especially passionate about simplifying complex data into formats that are easy on the eyes AND the brain.

The term “FooBar" is an impromptu variable name often used in Computer Science. I've adopted this moniker as a nod to the ever growing roster of titles associated with the work I do.

Have fun exploring this repository! Please reach out and "Say Hello", if you have questions, suggestions or would simply like to connect!
