Hey there! How's it going? 

I’m Elisabete (pronounced eee-lisa-bet), also known as “Betty”. Welcome to my GitHub Repository!

I'm passionate about using my programming skills to transform complex, messy datasets into visual formats that are both easy on the eyes and the brain. So far I've done this primarily through the statistical programming language and environment known as R, SQL and JasperSoft iReport. 

Many titles have been coined to decscribe the work I do, but in reflection of this ever-changing field of "Big Data", I've chosen to go with the Computer Science variable, "FooBar".

Have fun exploring this repository! Please reach out and "Say Hello", if you have questions, suggestions or would simply like to connect!
