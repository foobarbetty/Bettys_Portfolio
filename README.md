Hey there! How's it going? 

I’m Elisabete (pronounced eee-lisa-bet), also known as “Betty”. Welcome to my GitHub Repository!

Like the Computer Science variable “FooBar”, the term “Programmer” can represent many concepts. For me, it means using code to build tools that solve problems. 

I'm especially passionate about simplifying complex data into formats that are easy on the eyes AND the brain, and am currently pursuing Software Engineering and Web Development roles with a focus on building tools.

Have fun exploring this repository! Please reach out and "Say Hello", if you have questions, suggestions or would simply like to connect!
