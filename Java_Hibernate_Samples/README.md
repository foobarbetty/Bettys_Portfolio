This repository contains code related to a Hibernate Connection Tutorial I created, while working as a Tech Support Engineer for a local database start-up.

The steps in the tutorial may no longer be relevant (there have been some drastic changes between Hibernate versions), but I hope that this provides the general gist of how to connect a SQL database to Hibernate using Java. 

Happy coding, 
Elisabete
