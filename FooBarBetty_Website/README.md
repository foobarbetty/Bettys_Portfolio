A look at the code behind FooBarBetty.com

In the world of Tech, there is ALWAYS something new to learn. In fact, sometimes I need to take a minute to relearn, things I once thought I knew... ;)

It was time to ramp up on all things HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, again. So, I built myself a brand new website from scratch.

If you see something you like, by all means "leverage away". I'm also always open to suggestions, if you've got them. 

Alright, happy exploring!
