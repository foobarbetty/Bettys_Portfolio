FooBar(Betty) website
=========

This website serves two purposes: 

* A fun way to keep current with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP (I've built everything from scratch)
* A virtual resume and portfolio
* 
I'm continuosly adding new features and have learned so much in the process. As this is an ongoing project, you'll need to go right to the site for the most recent version of source code. Though I will try to update this repository, regularly. 

Happy exploring and as always, please don't hesitate to reach out with questions or suggestions.
