FooBar(Betty) website
=========

This website serves as a... 

* Fun way to keep current with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP (no templates here, folks!)
* Virtual resume and portfolio

I'm continuosly adding new features and have learned so much in the process. As this is an ongoing project, you'll want to go directly to the site for the most recent version of source code. Though I will try to update this repository, regularly. 

Happy exploring and as always, please don't hesitate to reach out with questions or suggestions.
