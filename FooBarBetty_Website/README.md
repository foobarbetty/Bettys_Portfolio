FooBar(Betty) website
=========

Well folks... www.foobarbetty.com is FINALLY "finished" and posted for all to see! 

As a way to ramp up on HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PHP, I've built everything from scratch and kept it all to just a single HTML and CSS file. 

It took way longer than anticipated (...of course it did) but I'm really proud of the result and learned so much in the process.

Happy exploring and as always, please don't hesitate to reach out with suggestions.
Betty
