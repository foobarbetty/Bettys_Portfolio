Most folks who know me as a programmer, know that I am head over heels in love with R. 

I'd been working with R since 2007, but it was during a predictive modeling project in 2010 that I finally experienced the power behind this open-source language and programming environment. I've been hooked ever since! 

This repository currently holds two basic R programs, which demonstrate how the language can be used as a basic scripting tool. Though, I do intend to add some more involved programs, in the near future.

Happy Coding, 
Elisabete
