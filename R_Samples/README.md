R Samples
===============

Most folks who know me as a programmer, know that I am head over heels in love with R. Though I'd been introduced to R years earlier, it was during a predictive modeling project in 2010 that I finally gained first hand experience of the power behind this open-source language and programming environment. I've been hooked ever since! 

This repository includes some very basic R samples, though I soon plan to add some of my more involved programs.

Happy Coding, 
Elisabete
